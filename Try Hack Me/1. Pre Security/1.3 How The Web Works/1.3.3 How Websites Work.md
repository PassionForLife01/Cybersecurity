## Introduction
You request, and the web server responses.

There are two major components that make up a website:
1. Front End (Client-Side) - the way your browser renders a website.
2. Back End (Server-Side) - a server that processes your request and returns a response.

The suites of front end:
- HTML -- structure and content
- JS       -- functionality
- CSS    -- style
## HTML 
```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
	<head>
		<title>Page Title</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1>Example Heading</h1>
		<p>Example paragraph.<p>
	</body>
</html>
```

A tag can has many attributes in it.
The attribute `id` should catch your attention.
Hyper link:
```html
<a href="http://hacker.com">Click Here!</a>
```
## JS
```js
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML="Hello";
```
