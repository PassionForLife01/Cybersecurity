## Processes
10.10.38.141
PID stands for Process ID.
PID increments for the order in which the process starts.
```sh
ps
ps aux
top # show the real-time statics
```

Kill the processes
```sh
kill
kill -SIGTERM <PID> # kill it, but allow it ot do some cleanup works
kill -SIGKILL <PID> # kill it, don't do any cleanup works. The most efficent
kill -SIGSTOP <PID> # stop/suspend
```
Or:
```sh
kill
kill -TERM <PID> # kill it, but allow it ot do some cleanup works
kill -KILL <PID> # kill it, don't do any cleanup works. The most efficent
kill -STOP <PID> # stop/suspend
```

Start the process.
The OS has its namespace. If those processes are in the same namespace, they can see each other.
Once the machine start up, there will be a program which initialize the OS. And every process after it will be its child process, sharing the same resource. This root process sits in between the operating system and the user.

Start on boot.
```sh
systemctl [options] [service]
[options]:
	- start   # just start
	- stop    # just stop
	- restart # just restart
	- enable  # start-up
	- disable # non-start-up
```

Foreground and background.

Run in background
```sh
command1 &
Ctrl + Z # For example, when you write something in nano, and ^Z
```

Return it into foreground
```sh
fg [job_spec]
```
When you Ctrl + Z a program, there will be a number, that's the `job_spec`.

![[Pasted image 20241123193020.png]]

If you ignore the `[job_spec]`, it will go back to the latest process which was stopped. In this case, is `[2]`. 
## Automation
```sh
cat /etc/crontab
```

Generate crontab
[[https://crontab-generator.org/]]

Explain crontab
[[https://crontab.guru/]]

Edit crontab
```sh
crontab -e
```

Startup at reboot
```sh
@reboot /var/opt/processes.sh
```
## Package Management
`apt`, short for a part of package management software.
If you are a developer, has written a program by yourself, you can submit it to the `apt` repository. Once approved, users can download from the `apt`.

And you can choose the repository, that is closer to your location. Since i am from China, so i choose the tsinghua repo.

And these repos are created by the operating system vendors, you can add other repo to your machine, such as the `sublime-text`. 

Install a program from third party repo. (`sublime-text`)

Get the GPG key:
```sh
wget -qO - https://download.sublimetext.com/sublimehq-pub.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
```

Add a source:
In directory `/etc/apt/source.list.d`
In file `sublime-text.list`
```
deb https://download.sublimetext.com/ apt/stable/
```

Update the `apt`, so it can realize there was a change.
```sh
apt update
```

Finally, install the program.
```sh
apt install sublime-text
```

Delete a program.

Delete the source.
```sh
sudo rm sublime-text.list
```

Update the `apt`.
```sh
sudo apt update
```

Finally, delete the program
## Logs
Logs will record the actions we have done.

In `/var/log`.

Especially in `/var/log/apache2`, `access.log`, `error.log`.
