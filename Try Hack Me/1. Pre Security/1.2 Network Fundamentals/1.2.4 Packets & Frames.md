# 1.2.4 Packets & Frames
## 1. What are Packets and Frames
![[QQ_1726847129294.png]]
Sending the data to the destination is just like sending a envelope which contains a envelope to that place. The outer envelope is the packet, and the inner envelope is the frame.

The packet contains the whole thing, like headers. And the frame is the content actually in it.

Networking is full of standards and protocols.

A packet will contains some information as followed:
Some notable headers include:

|                     |                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Header**          | **Description**                                                                                                                                                         |
| Time to Live        | This field sets an expiry timer for the packet to not clog up your network if it never manages to reach a host or escape!                                               |
| Checksum            | This field provides integrity checking for protocols such as TCP/IP. If any data is changed, this value will be different from what was expected and therefore corrupt. |
| Source Address      | The IP address of the device that the packet is being sent **from** so that data knows where to **return to**.                                                          |
| Destination Address | The device's IP address the packet is being sent to so that data knows where to travel next.                                                                            |

| 1        | SYN         | Initiate a connection by client                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 2        | SYN/ACK     | Server send this packet to ACK the synchronisation attempt from the client.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 3        | ACK         | The ACK packet can be used by either the client or server to acknowledge that a series of messages/packets have been successfully received.                                                                                                        |
| 4        | DATA        | Once a connection has been established, data (such as bytes of a file) is sent via the "DATA" message.                                                                                                                                             |
| 5        | FIN         | This packet is used to _cleanly (properly)_ close the connection after it has been complete.                                                                                                                                                       |
| #        | RST         | This packet abruptly ends all communication. This is the last resort and indicates there was some problem during the process. For example, if the service or application is not working correctly, or the system has faults such as low resources. |

| Time to Live (TTL)  | This field sets an expiry timer for the packet, so it doesn't clog up your network if it never manages to reach a host or escape! |
| Source Address      |                                                                                                                                   |

| Data                | This header is where data, i.e. bytes of a file that is being transmitted, is stored.                                             |

## 4. Posts 101
Posts are used to manage different messages will go to the right place within a PC.
 Any port that is within **0** and **1024** (1,024) is known as a common port.
### Common Port

| **F**ile **T**ransfer **P**rotocol (**FTP**)                       | 21              | This protocol is used by a file-sharing application built on a client-server model, meaning you can download files from a central location.                |
| **S**ecure **Sh**ell (**SSH**)                                     | 22              | This protocol is used to securely login to systems via a text-based interface for management.                                                              |
| **H**yper**T**ext Transfer Protocol (**HTTP**)                     | 80              | This protocol powers the World Wide Web (WWW)! Your browser uses this to download text, images and videos of web pages.                                    |
| **H**yper**T**ext **T**ransfer **P**rotocol **S**ecure (**HTTPS**) | 443             | This protocol does the exact same as above; however, securely using encryption.                                                                            |
| **S**erver **M**essage **B**lock (**SMB**)                         | 445             | This protocol is similar to the File Transfer Protocol (FTP); however, as well as files, SMB allows you to share devices like printers.                    |
| **R**emote **D**esktop **P**rotocol (**RDP**)                      | 3389            | This protocol is a secure means of logging in to a system using a visual desktop interface (as opposed to the text-based limitations of the SSH protocol). |
