## 1. What is Networking
Networks are integrated into our everyday life. Be it gathering data for the weather, delivering electricity to homes or even determining who has the right of way at a road. Because networks are so embedded in the modern-day, networking is an essential concept to grasp in cybersecurity.

Network is the key term for devices that are connected together.
## 2. What is the Internet
A network can be one of two types:  
- A private network  
	These small networks are called private networks.
- A public network
	Where networks connecting these small networks are called public networks -- or the Internet!.

## 3. Identifying Devices on a Network
To identify a human:
- Our Name
- Our Fingerprints
To identify a device:
- An IP Address
- A Media Access Control (MAC) Address -- think of this as being similar to a serial number.

### IP Addresses
Briefly, an IP address (or **I**nternet **P**rotocol) address can be used as a way of identifying a host on a network for a period of time, where that IP address can then be associated with another device without the IP address changing.

An **IP** address is a set of numbers that are divided into four octets.

A public address is used to identify the device on the Internet, whereas a private address is used to identify a device amongst other devices.

These two devices will be able to use their private IP addresses to communicate with each other. However, any data sent to the Internet from either of these devices will be identified by **the same public IP address**. Public IP addresses are given by your **I**nternet **S**ervice **P**rovider (or **ISP**) at a monthly fee (your bill!)

As more and more devices become connected, it is becoming increasingly harder to get a public address that isn't already in use. For example, Cisco, an industry giant in the world of networking, estimated that there would be approximately 50 billion devices connected on the Internet by the end of 2021. [(Cisco., 2021)](https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en_us/about/ac79/docs/innov/IoT_IBSG_0411FINAL.pdf). Enter IP address versions. So far, we have only discussed one version of the Internet Protocol addressing scheme known as IPv4, which uses a numbering system of 2^32 IP addresses (4.29 billion) -- so you can see why there is such a shortage!

IPv6 is a new iteration of the Internet Protocol addressing scheme to help tackle this issue. Although it is seemingly more daunting, it boasts a few benefits:

- Supports up to 2^128 of IP addresses (340 trillion-plus), resolving the issues faced with IPv4
- More efficient due to new methodologies
- Have 16 bytes aka 128 bits (since two hexadecimal digits equal to one byte or 8 bits)

The screenshot below compares both an IPv6 and IPv4 address.

IP Addresses follow a set of standards known as protocols. These protocols **are the backbone of networking** and force many devices to communicate in the same language
### MAC Addresses
Devices on a network will all have a physical network interface, which is a microchip board found on the device's motherboard. This network interface is assigned a unique address at the factory it was built at, called a **MAC** (**M**edia **A**ccess **C**ontrol ) address. The MAC address is a **twelve-character** hexadecimal number

However, an interesting thing with MAC addresses is that they can be faked or "spoofed" in a process known as spoofing. 
Take the following scenario: A firewall is configured to allow any communication going to and from the MAC address of the administrator. If a device were to pretend or "spoof" this MAC address, the firewall would now think that it is receiving communication from the administrator when it isn't.
## 4. Ping (ICMP)
Ping is one of the most fundamental network tools available to us. Ping uses **ICMP** (**I**nternet **C**ontrol **M**essage **P**rotocol) packets to determine the performance of a connection between devices.

Pings can be performed against devices on a network, such as your home network or resources like websites.

```
ping IP address or website URL
```
