## 1. What is the OSI Model?
The **OSI** model (or **O**pen **S**ystems **I**nterconnection Model). This critical model provides ==a framework dictating how all networked devices will send, receive and interpret data.==

This model can be considered as a universal language in the network.

The model consists of ==seven layers==.

The term encapsulation is adding information to the data.
## 2. Layer 7 - Application
![[QQ_1726289128979.png]]
This layer is the layer in which protocols and rules are in place to determine how the user should interact with data sent or received. 

Examples:
- File sever browsing software FileZilla
- DNS (Domain Name System ) protocol
## 3. Layer 6 - Presentation
![[QQ_1726289143080.png]]
The standardisation starts at this layer.
The layer acts as a translator for data and from application layer (Layer 7).
This layer translate data from one form to another.

Examples:
- When you send an email, the receiving computer may has different email client to you, but the content should be the same. 
- HTTPS occur at this layer.
## 4. Layer 5 - Session
![[QQ_1726289158048.png]]
Once the data are translated to the form that local computer can understand, the session layer will create a connection to other computer that the data is destined for. 

When a connection is established, a session is created.

This layer will synchronizes the two computer to ensure they are on the same page. Once these checks are in place. The session layer will begin divide up the the data that will be sent into small chunks of data and begin to send these chunks(aka. packets) one at a time. 

Only the chunks that weren't yet sent will have to send again -- not the entire data.

The session is unique, meaning that data cannot travel over different session, only across one session.
## 5. Layer 4 - Transport
![[QQ_1726289172837.png]]
There are two protocols used to send data between devices.
- TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
- UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
### 5.1 TCP
TCP 
TCP is designed with reliability and guarantee.
TCP reserves a constant connection between the two devices.
TCP incorporates error checking for the data sent from session layer.

Let's summarise the advantages and disadvantages of TCP in the table below.

|                                                                                          |                                                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Advantages of TCP**                                                                    | **Disadvantages of TCP  <br>**                                                                                                                    |
| Guarantees the accuracy of data.                                                         | Requires a reliable connection between the two devices. If one small chunk of data is not received, then the entire chunk of data cannot be used. |
| Capable of synchronising two devices to prevent each other from being flooded with data. | A slow connection can bottleneck another device as the connection will be reserved on the receiving computer the whole time.                      |
| Performs a lot more processes for reliability.                                           | TCP is significantly slower than UDP because more work has to be done by the devices using this protocol.                                         |
TCP is used for situations such as file sharing, internet browsing or sending an email.

### 5.2 UDP

|                                                                                                                       |                                                                                    |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Advantages of UDP**                                                                                                 | **Disadvantages of UDP**                                                           |
| UDP is much faster than TCP.                                                                                          | UDP doesn't care if the data is received.                                          |
| UDP leaves the application layer (user software) to decide if there is any control over how quickly packets are sent. | It is quite flexible to software developers in this sense.                         |
| UDP does not reserve a continuous connection on a device as TCP does.                                                 | This means that unstable connections result in a terrible experience for the user. |

UDP can be used for discovering devices (ARP and DHCP) or larger file such as video streaming.
## 6. Layer 3 - Network
![[QQ_1726289185687.png]]
Routing
Re-assembly
### Routing
Find the optimal path.
![[QQ_1726289214119.png]]
There are some protocols determine what is the "optimal" path, such as OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) and RIP (Routing Information Protocol).

The factors that decide what route is taken is decided by the following:
- What path is the shortest? I.e. has the least amount of devices that the packet needs to travel across.
- What path is the most reliable? I.e. have packets been lost on that path before?
- Which path has the faster physical connection? I.e. is one path using a copper connection (slower) or a fibre (considerably faster)?

Additionally the IP address will be used in this layer.
## 7. Layer 2 - Data Link
![[QQ_1726289241713.png]]
This layer focuses on the physical addressing of the transmission. It will receive the packets from network layer (including IP address) and adds the MAC address.
	Inside every network-enabled computer is a NIC (Network Interface Card). It is unique and was set by the manufacturer.

This layer will also present the data in a form suitable for transmission.
## 8. Layer 1 - Physical
![[QQ_1726289662247.png]]
This layer is the physical fundament of network.
