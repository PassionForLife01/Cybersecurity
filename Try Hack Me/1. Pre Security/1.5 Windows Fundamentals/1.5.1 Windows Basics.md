### Permissions
permission in NTFS:

| **Permission**       | For Folder                               | For File |     |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------- | --- |
| Read                 | read                                     |          |     |
| Write                | write                                    |          |     |
| Read & Execute       | read & execute                           |          |     |
| List Folder Contents | read & execute, inherited by folders     |          |     |
| Modify               | write, delete                            |          |     |
| Full Control         | reading, writing, changing, and deleting |          |     |

Right-click a folder or disk, turn to `security` tab , and then you can see the permission of groups.

### ADS
Reference:
https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/101/2015/07/introduction-to-alternate-data-streams

Alternate Data Streams, short for ADS, is specific to NTFS.

Every file has at least one data stream (`$DATA`), and ADS allow files to contain more than one stream of data.

The data stream `$DATA`, just contains the raw data of that file. And the name string of this attribute is empty ( “” )

And other named data stream can be considered alternate.

It can be written secretly by malware.
But not all ADS is malicious. For example, there are identifiers written to identify that file was downloaded from Internet.

![[Pasted image 20241215223044.png]]

To insert an ADS into file:
```sh
echo hello > ads.txt
```

```sh
set-content -path .\ads.txt -stream myads
```

![[Pasted image 20241215220938.png]]
template:
```
set-content - path {path to the file} - stream {name of the stream}
```

To get the ADS
```sh
get-item -path ./ads.txt -stream *
```

![[Pasted image 20241215221532.png]]

```sh
get-content -path .\ads.txt -stream $DATA
get-content -path .\ads.txt -stream ""
```

![[Pasted image 20241215222328.png]]

```sh
get-content -path .\ads.txt -stream myads
```

To search ADS
```sh
gci -recurse | % { gi $_.FullName -stream * } | where stream -ne ':$Data'
```

To remove ADS
```sh
remove-item -path ./ads.txt -stream myads
```

```sh
remove-item –path {path to the file} –stream {name of the stream}
```

### Bonus 
If you wish to interact hands-on with ADS, I suggest exploring Day 21 of [Advent of Cyber 2](https://tryhackme.com/room/adventofcyber2).
## Windows/System32 Folders

The `Windows` folder contains the windows operating system, and there are many import utilities in its subfolder.

The path of `Windows` is stored in environment variable `%windir%` in `cmd`.
Environment variables store the info about operating system environment, including operating system path, and location of temporary folder.

And the `System32` folder is very important, including a lot of essential utilities of windows, such as `cmd`, `task manager`, and so on. 
Don't try to delete this folder, or you can only repair it by reinstallation. 

## Accounts

`System Settings > Other users`
You can add a user, or modify a user here.
If you add a user, it will open the Local User and Group Management automatically.

Each user profile will have the same folders; a few of them are:
- Desktop
- Documents
- Downloads
- Music
- Pictures

Another way to access this information, and then some, is using **Local User and Group Management**.

`Win + R > lusrmgr.msc`

You can see the users and what group they are belonged to. The created user will inherit the permission of that group.

The details are not shown here.

## User Account Control

When you are logged in as admin, the current session doesn't run with elevated permission. When an operation needs a high-level privilege, the user will be prompted to confirm if they permit the operation to run.

![[Pasted image 20241220162314.png]]

This can avoid the malware that logged in as admin by some ways but don't know password. 

And any operation under UAC, would be covered by a shield icon.

Note: UAC (by default) doesn't apply for the built-in local administrator account.

## Settings and Control Panel

Make system change.
These two things have similar functionality.

But control panel has more complex options than setting.

Settings:
![[QQ_1734684316839.png]]
Start Menu > Settings

Control Panel:
![[Pasted image 20241220164550.png]]

`Win + R` > `Enter "control"`
## Task Manager

Shortcut: `Ctrl+Shift+Esc`

What is service?
	A type of application that runs in the background, without direct interaction with user.
For example, Web service will always listen on port 80/433, without manually manipulating.
