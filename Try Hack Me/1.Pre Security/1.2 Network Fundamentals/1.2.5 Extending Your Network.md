# 1.2.5 Extending Your Network
## 1. Introduction to Port Forwarding
### Before Port Forwarding

### After Port Forwarding

### Where are this configured?
Port forwarding is configured at the router of a network.
## 2. Firewalls 101
Control what should enter and what should exit.
### Common Types
firewalls can be categorized into 2 to 5 categories.
We'll cover the two primary categories of firewalls in the table below:

|                       |                                    |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Firewall Category** | **Description**                    |
| Stateful              | inspects the **entire connection** |
| Stateless             | inspects individual packets        |
A router can be configured as a firewall.
## 3. VPN Basics
VPN, short for Virtual Private Network.
This technology will create a tunnel between two networks.

| PPP                | This technology is used by PPTP (explained below) to allow for authentication and provide encryption of data. <br><br>This technology is not capable of leaving a network by itself (non-routable).                                                                                   |
| PPTP               | The **P**oint-to-**P**oint **T**unneling **P**rotocol (**PPTP**) is the technology that allows the data from PPP to travel and leave a network. <br><br>PPTP is very easy to set up and is supported by most devices. It is, however, weakly encrypted in comparison to alternatives. |
| IPSec              | Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) encrypts data using the existing **I**nternet **P**rotocol (**IP**) framework.<br><br>IPSec is difficult to set up in comparison to alternatives; however, if successful, it boasts strong encryption and is also supported on many devices.       |
## 4. LAN Networking Devices
### Router
Find the optimal path for data traveling. Operating at Layer 3 at the OIS model.
![[Pasted image 20241006113350.png]]

The factors that will affect the routing are as followded:
- What path is the shortest?
- What path is the most reliable?  
- Which path has the faster medium (e.g. copper or fibre)?
### Switch
#### Layer 2 Switch
These switches will forward frames (remember these are no longer packets as the IP protocol has been stripped) onto the connected devices using their MAC address.

#### Layer 3 Switch
This switch can also act as a router in network.

This technology that split up the network is called VALN (Virtual LAN).
