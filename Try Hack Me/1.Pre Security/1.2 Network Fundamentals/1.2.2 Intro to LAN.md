LAN -- Local Area Network
## 1. Introducing LAN Topologies
### Local Area Network (LAN) Topologies
#### Star Topology
All the data are transferred to the central switch, and the switch will send these data to its destined computer in these network.

- Advantage
	much more scalable
- Disadvantage
	expensive
	If the centralised hardware that connects devices fails, these devices will no longer be able to send or receive data.
#### Bus Topology
In this topology, data is sent in both left and right directions down the backbone until the packet's destination is reached

- Advantage
	Cheap
- Disadvantage
	If this cable were to break, devices can no longer receive or transmit data along the bus.
	It can't handle a large amount of data
#### Ring Topology

- Advantage
	Easy to troubleshoot
- Disadvantage
	Once the cable is broken, the entire network will be down. Because all the data are transferred into one direction. 
### Switch
![[QQ_1724639484364.png]]
Switch offers many ports to the computers. When they receive a packet, it just sends it to the intended target, thus reducing network traffic.

If one path goes down, another can be used.

It may reduce the performance of the network due to it will travels long time. But there is no down time.

### Router

It's a router's job to connect networks and pass data between them. It does this by using routing (hence the name router!).
## 2. A Primer on Subnetting
Subnet mask is represented as four bytes, ranging from 0 to 255. 

Subnets use IP addresses in three different ways:
- Identify the network address
- Identify the host address
- Identify the default gateway

So there are some ways to manage the network by spilting the IP address.

| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| **Type**        | **Purpose**                                                                                                                                    | **Explanation**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | **Example**   |
| Network Address | This address identifies the start of the actual network and is used to identify a network's existence.                                         | For example, a device with the IP address of 192.168.1.100 will be on the network identified by 192.168.1.0                                                                                                                                          | 192.168.1.0   |
| Host Address    | An IP address here is used to identify a device on the subnet                                                                                  | For example, a device will have the network address of 192.168.1.1                                                                                                                                                                                   | 192.168.1.100 |
| Default Gateway | The default gateway address is a special address assigned to a device on the network that is capable of sending information to another network | Any data that needs to go to a device that isn't on the same network (i.e. isn't on 192.168.1.0) will be sent to this device. These devices can use any host address but usually use either the first or last host address in a network (.1 or .254) | 192.168.1.254 |
## 3. The ARP Protocol
Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is responsible for finding the MAC (hardware) address related to a specific IP address. It works by broadcasting an ARP query, "Who has this IP address? Tell me." And the response is of the form, "The IP address is at this MAC address."

Each device within a network has a ledger to store information on, which is called a **cache**. In the context of the ARP protocol, this **cache** stores the identifiers of other devices on the network.

Actually the ARP send two types of messages:
1. **ARP Request**
2. **ARP Reply**

When an **ARP request** is sent, a message is broadcasted on the network to other devices asking, "What is the mac address that owns this IP address?" When the other devices receive that message, they will only respond if they own that IP address and will send an **ARP reply** with its MAC address. The requesting device can now remember this mapping and store it in its **ARP cache** for future use.

## 4. The DHCP Protocol
IP addresses can be assigned either **manually**, by entering them physically into a device, or **automatically** and most commonly by using a **DHCP** (**D**ynamic **H**ost **C**onfiguration **P**rotocol) server.
