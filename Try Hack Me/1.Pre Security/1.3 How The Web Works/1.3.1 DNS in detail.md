TLD (Top Level Domain) :
- gTLD (generic Top Level Domain): .com, .org, .gov
- ccTLD (Country Code Top Level Domain): .cn, .uk, .ca
Second Level Domain:
  Second-level domain is limited to 63 characters + the TLD and can only use a-z 0-9 and hyphens (cannot start or end with hyphens or have consecutive hyphens).
Subdomain:
  Limited to 63 characters and can only use a-z 0-9 and hyphens (cannot start or end with hyphens or have consecutive hyphens). 

There are no limitations for the number of subdomain.
But the maximum length of a domain name is 253.
