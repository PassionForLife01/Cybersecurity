# 1.4.1 Linux Fundamentals Part 1
This command will look up through our current directory.
```sh
find -name passwords.txt
```

This command will look up through our current directory, for the specific file with a `.txt` extension.
```sh
find -name *.txt
```

But shell maybe expand the `*.txt`, so the more secure way is quoting it.
```sh
find -name '*.txt'
```

Find the flag file.
```sh
find . -name 'flag.txt'
```

The difference between single quotes and double quotes:
- `'` just represent the literal string, not interpret some special thing in it.
- `"` will interpret the `variable expansion, command substitution` in it.
```sh
echo '$HOME'

echo "Your home is ${HOME}"
```

`grep` will output a line containing the `"word"`.
```sh
grep "word" access.log
```

This is a useful tool to find the flag in some files.
```sh
grep -E "flag\{[^\}]+\}"
```

Shell Operator
- `&` -- run in background
- `|` -- pipe
- `&&` (`||`)
- `>`
- `>>`

Will create the new line character automatically.
```sh
echo howdy > welcome
```
Append.
```sh
echo hey >> welcome
```
